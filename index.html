<h2>The plot</h2>

<p>The show covers the battle between the lords of the continent of Westeros — most notably members of the 
    <span>Baratheon</span>, 
    <span>Lannister</span>, and 
    <span>Stark families</span>
     — who are involved in the fight for the Iron Throne. This follows the rise of <span>Daenerys Targaryen</span>, the last member of an exiled family as she builds an army in Essos to reclaim the throne.</p>
